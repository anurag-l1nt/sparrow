welcome.title=Welcome to Sparrow
welcome.step1.introduction=Introduction
welcome.step1.label1=Sparrow is a Bitcoin wallet with a focus on security and usability.
welcome.step1.label2=Sparrow can operate in both an online and offline mode. In the online mode it connects to a server to display transaction history. In the offline mode it is useful as a transaction editor and as an airgapped multisig coordinator.
welcome.step1.label3=The status bar at the bottom displays the connection status, as demonstrated below:
welcome.step2.introduction=Connecting to a Public Server
welcome.step2.label1=If you are beginning your journey in self custody, or just storing a small amount, the easiest way to connect Sparrow to the Bitcoin blockchain is via one of the preconfigured public Electrum servers.
welcome.step2.label2=However, although Sparrow only connects to servers that have a record of respecting privacy, it is still not ideal as you are sharing your transaction history and balance with them.
welcome.step2.label3=A yellow toggle means you are connected to a public server.
welcome.step3.introduction=Connecting to a Bitcoin Core node
welcome.step3.label1=If you are running your own Bitcoin Core node, you can configure Sparrow to connect to it directly.
welcome.step3.label2=This means you are not sharing your transaction data, but be aware Bitcoin Core stores your balance, transactions and public keys unencrypted on that node, which is not ideal for true cold storage.
welcome.step3.label3=A green toggle means you are connected to a Bitcoin Core node.
welcome.step4.introduction=Connecting to a Private Electrum Server
welcome.step4.label1=The most private way to connect is to your own Electrum server, which in turn connects to your Bitcoin Core node.
welcome.step4.label2=Because these servers index all Bitcoin transactions equally, your wallet transactions are never stored on the server in an identifiable way, and your server forgets your requests immediately after serving them.
welcome.step4.label3=A blue toggle means you are connected to a private Electrum server. You're now ready to configure a server and start using Sparrow!
